                <b>Description</b><br></p>
               <p> Do you remember the typical scenery we used to draw in every 'drawing period'? Mountains, Sun rising between the mountain valleys, a river and a hut were all that were needed with a splash of color green. However, gone are those days of the typical scenery. Children have become smart these days, and a typical scenery now would consist either of a playground, a beach, a desert to name a few. We take this task a few steps ahead. Using your creative juices, and your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools, we present you the challenge of creating a digital scenery. You can have a look at our (incomplete) scenery demo here.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px"><b>Rules</b></p>
                 <ul class="a">
                <li><p>Remember that this demo consists only of a few elements, your scenery is required to be complete in itself, and could be anything else as well ( a playground perhaps, as an idea). You may also include animated elements in your scenery, as in the demo.</p></li>
                <li><p>We love original ideas, and dislike any sort of plagiarism. Plagiarism shows the absence of creativity. All your entries shall be duly checked for plagiarism.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remember, clock is up till <b>20 feb. 2016</b></p></li>
                <li><p>Submit your zip-folder containing all the relevant files on below link.<br><br></p></li>
